## Objective:
The main objective behind this project is to put together the skills learned from HTML, CSS and JS to build a related website.

## Step 1:
The project was built and this includes: Creating folders, addings files, and connecting files using a texteditor VSC.

## Step 2:
This includes the designing of the front page of the website. Looking at the top left corner of the website, you will see that there were two Nav-bar links, one for the home page while the second page is the about page link. 

## Step 3:
Portfolio item grid, these steps include loading th emain content of step 2 which is the nav-bar link. The Home link is a portfolio with 12 images item 3 by 4 grid with text and animation when hover over. And the About link is a little description of myself and my picture.

## Limitations:
Although the primary aim was to put my knowledge on HTML, CSS, and JS to work, but  the website did not come out pretty well just as I wanted it to. I want it to be more
related with a specific dimension. I see it as a work in progress
